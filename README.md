# Allium
Lua Plugin loader for Java Minecraft.

Currently, only functioning and in development in fabric, but should (in theory) be very easily portable to forge.

## But Allium is for ComputerCraft?
You're right! That's moved to (allium-cc)[https://github.com/hugeblank/allium-cc]. I think this project is going to be
more important going forward, as it has serious utility, moreso than the dinky CC counterpart. Plus this is in active
development, so stick around!
