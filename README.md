# Allium
[![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-908a85?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/hugeblank/allium)

Lua script loader & toolchain for Java Minecraft.

Currently, only functioning and in development in fabric, with the intent of supporting 
forge/quilt later on down the road.

Lua scripts are stored in a directory named `allium` in the game directory root.  

## Examples
Sometimes the best way to learn is by example, this is especially true for understanding how to structure allium 
scripts. You can find these demonstrations in the `examples` directory. If you'd like to play with these scripts 
yourself, simply drag and drop them into the `allium` directory.

## But Allium is for ComputerCraft?
Allium for CC has been moved to [allium-cc](https://github.com/hugeblank/allium-cc). I think this project is going to be
more important going forward, as it has serious utility, more so than its dinky CC counterpart. Plus this is in active 
development, so stick around!
